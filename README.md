# About
In this repository, I classify, annotate, and document my thoughts on papers I read. I learned this organization from Fredrik K. Gustafsson[@fregu856](https://github.com/fregu856).

Well-writen paper about the relationship between partitioned survival models vs. state-transition models. Figure 1 is informative and pedagogical.

Mark and I discussed this guideline. It has various recommendation on health economics modelling practices. Recommendation 9--CADTH guidance says, "A partition survival model structure is not recommended as it relies on an assumption of independence between curves." We are wondering whether this statement is true or not. What is the difference between using a partitioned survival vs. an illness-death model. This might be an interesting topic to explore further to compare 1) K-M ; 2) ; 3) Partitioned survival
